        <p>In February 1999, I landed my first professional job at an advertising agency in Essen, Germany. I crafted my first Bewerbung using Microsoft Word and convinced my parents to invest $100 to send my B.F.A. portfolio—packed in my now-infamous silver case. I was hired on the spot and asked if I could start the following Monday.</p>
        <p>That Monday in early February 1999 set into motion one of the most amazing, terrifying, complicated, and eye-opening work experiences I could have imagined. Over the years, my journey has evolved beyond traditional design, embracing front-end development and the endless possibilities of digital interaction. Alongside my passion for crafting thoughtful user experiences, photography has remained a constant in my creative life—another way to capture, frame, and tell stories.</p>

        <p>Great design tells a story. As an art director, I shape visual narratives that connect, inspire, and leave a lasting impression. Whether crafting brand identities, designing campaigns, or refining aesthetics, I thrive on bringing creative visions to life with clarity and purpose.</p>

        <h5 class=" mb-xs">Photography</h5>
        <p>Photography is my way of capturing moments that words can’t express. From conceptual shoots to documentary-style storytelling, I focus on composition, light, and emotion to create images that resonate. Every frame is an opportunity to distill an experience into something timeless.</p>
