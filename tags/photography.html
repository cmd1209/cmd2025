title: "Photography"
description: "I studied photography as part of my graphic design studies and came to Germany with my analog Canon AE-1. After years away from peeking through the viewfinder, I realized that this part of my creativity had been missing. Photography for me is about reconnecting with that hands-on, observational side â€” noticing light, detail, and moments that tell a story in a way only the lens can capture."
