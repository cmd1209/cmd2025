    <p>Almost a year before Calumet’s Hamburg headquarters move-in date (Fall 2024), I was asked to collaborate directly with management on shaping the new space. My role was to design the look and feel of the HQ — making sure the physical environment reflected the company’s identity and supported how teams actually work day to day.</p>

    <p>The project began with concept development: I created proposals that balanced functionality with brand expression. These early ideas set the tone for everything that followed, from material choices and colors to how common areas and workspaces could express Calumet’s values.</p>

        <p>One of the most important results was a room-naming concept. Using results from a company-wide survey, I created names for every meeting space and designed a visual system that combined the Calumet logo with each name. Since most rooms had glass walls, these designs were produced as large vinyl stickers — a simple but effective way to bring identity and clarity into the space.</p>

    <p>I also introduced large-format inspirational photography to cover non-glass walls, giving the office a strong visual character and connecting the environment to the creative spirit of the company. Beyond graphics, I supported management in choosing furniture and decorations, ensuring consistency with the design direction. To cap it off, I organized a company-wide photography call: employees contributed images that were framed and displayed in the “Meet and Mingle” room — a space dedicated to community and collaboration.</p>

    <p>The result was a headquarters that doesn’t just function as an office, but embodies Calumet’s culture: professional, creative, and inclusive, with employees directly contributing to the look and feel of the space.</p>
