<h5>The Challenge</h5>
<p>Calumet, Germany’s largest online retailer for camera and video equipment, needed a brand identity that didn’t look like it had been left on “auto mode.” I was originally brought in as the guy with taste and design know-how — someone to sketch concepts and sharpen the look.</p>

    <h5>The Turning Point</h5>
    <p>A few months in, the CEO and Chief Online Officer decided that if I was going to keep pushing the brand forward, I might as well be the one in charge of it. So I became Head of Art Direction — which meant the redesign suddenly grew from “make things look nicer” to “reimagine everything”: online, in-store, corporate culture, external communication… basically everywhere the brand showed its face.</p>

    <h5>My Role</h5>
    <p>I went from being “the guy with taste” to running what felt like a full-service agency inside Calumet. Along the way, I built and mentored a design team, set up systems that actually worked, and kept the whole thing moving — with just enough humor to keep it fun.</p>

    <h5>The Approach</h5>
    <ul class="list_standard">
      <li>Create a visual identity that respected Calumet’s heritage while dragging it firmly into the present.</li>
      <li>Build a design system that worked across all channels (and even came with folder structures that made sense — a rare thing in corporate life).</li>
      <li>Work with in-house designers and freelancers like we were running our own little in-house agency.</li>
      <li>Convince people that design isn’t decoration — it’s strategy in disguise.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-6 mt-sm mb-sm">
    <h5>The Results</h5>
    <ul class="list_standard">
      <li>A brand that finally looked as professional as the company itself.</li>
      <li>One consistent design language across web, social, retail, print, and even the new HQ.</li>
      <li>Workflows that saved time, stress, and at least three collective headaches per week.</li>
      <li>Stakeholders who now talk about “brand” with something close to enthusiasm.</li>
    </ul>
