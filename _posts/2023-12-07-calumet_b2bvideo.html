<p>Sometimes, the best way to reconnect with your creative roots is to just dive in. I found myself back in After Effects for a small project targeting Calumet’s B2B division — specifically professional photographers and studios.</p>

<p>The goal was simple: show that Calumet isn’t just a supplier of equipment, but a partner throughout the creative process — from pre-shoot advice to hands-on support during the session.</p>

<p>I focused on dynamic video segments that highlight the range of products while keeping the tone professional yet approachable. It was a great exercise in storytelling through motion, and a reminder that even small projects can have a big impact when they resonate with the audience.</p>
