    <p>For Wempe, one of Germany’s most renowned jewelers, we developed a weekly email newsletter that balanced refined brand storytelling with efficient production workflows. The challenge was to adapt to Emarsys, a completely new platform for our team, while maintaining the high visual standards expected of the Wempe brand.</p>
    <p>Each week we received briefings detailing the focus products and themes. From there, we designed layouts that not only captured the luxurious look and feel of the brand, but also minimized the time required for technical implementation. Every detail — typography, imagery, and spacing — was optimized to ensure a seamless transition from creative concept to functional email.</p>

<h3 class="mission text-center mb-xl mt-xl color-headline-teal"><span>Turning weekly briefings</span> <span>into elegant,</span><span> ready-to-send campaigns</span><span>within hours — that was our benchmark.</span></h3>
<div class="row gap-md mb-xl">
  <div class="col-6">
    <p>By creating modular templates and anticipating the requirements of the Emarsys system, we built a process that turned weekly iterations into a smooth, predictable flow. This efficiency allowed us to deliver polished newsletters under tight deadlines, while giving Wempe’s customers a consistently premium digital experience.</p>
