<p>At the beginning of 2020, I had the opportunity to design an exclusive customer services booklet for Wempe. The idea was simple yet ambitious: create a piece that customers would receive alongside their purchase, one that felt just as refined and enduring as the jewelry and timepieces it accompanied.</p>

<div class="row gap-md mb-xl">
  <div class="col-6">
    <img src="{{page.image.gallery}}{{page.image.cutout}}" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="col-6">
    <p>The process began with Pantone-selected colors and tactile textures on the cover, setting the tone for what was inside — a design that radiated exclusivity and care. Every page was crafted to highlight Wempe’s history of customer service and dedication to detail, weaving together heritage and modern refinement.</p>
  </div>

<p>Early in the booklet, one sentence captures the spirit of the project, a guiding principle from Gerhard D. Wempe himself:</p>
    <blockquote>My aim shall be to provide our valued customers with the best products, the widest selection, and the most courteous treatment.</blockquote>

<p>That quote became the backbone of the design approach: elegant, timeless, and deeply personal, ensuring the booklet felt like more than information — it became part of the Wempe experience.</p>
