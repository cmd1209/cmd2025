<h4 class="mb-md">Display Animation for Wempe’s Diamond Week</h4>
<p>Before joining the advertising agency as a senior art director, I had already built experience creating motion graphics for museums — projects that balanced clarity, storytelling, and visual impact. When I arrived at the agency, most animation work was outsourced. One day I mentioned that I had done motion projects in the cultural sector and could take on similar tasks if they were open to it. They gave me a chance — and it quickly took off from there.</p>

<p>One early highlight was a screen animation for Wempe’s “Diamond Week”, showcased in selected stores across Germany. The goal was to design something luxurious yet understated, that could catch attention in a retail environment while staying true to Wempe’s refined identity.</p>

<p>Working in After Effects, I developed smooth transitions and subtle effects to bring an exclusive feel to the in-store screens. The project underscored for me how motion graphics can heighten a luxury brand experience — and how skills gained in one sector (museums) can be translated into another (retail and high-end jewelry).</p>
