<p>A full day in New York, moving from the rush of Grand Central, to the crowds and chaos of the Brooklyn Bridge, and ending at Washington Square. The bridge in particular was unforgettable — a crush of people, noise, and energy, and then the sudden urgency of rushing off just before the skies opened up. These photos capture fragments of that day — the motion, the atmosphere, and the sense that in New York, every corner holds a story.
