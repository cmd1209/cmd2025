<p>In early 2020, I led a two-week design sprint focused on rapidly building and testing a new digital experience. We began with a library of core design elements — typography, colors, icons, and layout modules — which served as the foundation for everything that followed. From there, we combined these individual parts into structured design groups, exploring how different elements could interact and support each other.</p>

<p>As the sprint progressed, we shifted from exploration to integration. The design groups were refined and assembled into a unified system, ensuring consistency and scalability across the full experience. By the end of the sprint, we had not only created a cohesive design language but also prepared everything for the next stage.</p>

<p>The final step was a seamless handoff to an external development studio. With clear design documentation, prototypes, and assets in place, they were able to build a working prototype of the site based directly on our sprint outcomes. This process demonstrated the efficiency of focused, time-boxed design work — moving from abstract elements to a tangible, functional prototype in just two weeks.</p>
