<p>Some days the only time to shoot is in the margins — a few minutes before work, a quick walk at lunch, or catching the light on the way home. These photographs from Hamburg were made in that in-between time, when the city reveals itself in small, fleeting moments. It’s a reminder that even in the rush of daily life, there’s always room to pause and see.
