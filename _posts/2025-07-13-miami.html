<p>For some reason I imagined setting down in Miami, after our flight from Frankfurt, and being immediatly blown away by the blue skies and water. But no, we arrived in the middle of some crazy summer storm, and the arrivals and uber pick up was being flooded at the time.</p>

<p>The following day, the weather had cleared and Miami was just as I had imagined—blue skies and bright sunlight. With only one full day to explore, we wandered through the vibrant streets of Little Havana, where the air was filled with the sounds of salsa music and the aroma of Cuban coffee. Colorful murals and lively domino games in Máximo Gómez Park made the neighborhood feel welcoming and full of energy. Even with limited time, we managed to sample some authentic Cuban food and soak in the unique atmosphere that makes Miami so memorable. I also took some shots of the historic Tower Theater, a striking landmark that stands as a testament to the neighborhood's rich cultural heritage.</p>
